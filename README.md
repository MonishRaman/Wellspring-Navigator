# 🌟 Medical Diagnosis System 🌟

A Flask-based **Medical Diagnosis System** designed to assist healthcare workers in diagnosing common diseases based on symptoms. The system uses dynamic questionnaires, weighted scoring, and case-based reasoning to provide accurate and reliable diagnoses.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Dynamic Symptom Matching**: Diagnoses diseases based on user-provided symptoms.
- **Disease Explanation**: Displays matched symptoms and confidence levels.
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly interface with animations and responsive design.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Allows users to confirm or override diagnoses for continuous learning.
- **Environmental Data Integration**: Refines diagnoses using regional and seasonal factors.
- **Deployable**: Easily deployable on platforms like Heroku, Streamlit, or Vercel.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database**: SQLite (optional for storing cases and feedback)
- **Deployment**: Heroku, Streamlit, or Vercel
